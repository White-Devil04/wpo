# WPO – Architecture, Concepts, and Rationale

This document explains the end‑to‑end architecture, design decisions, performance methodology, AI integration, metrics pipeline, and UI/UX system for the Web Performance Optimizer (WPO).

## 1) Technologies Used and Why

- **Next.js 16 (App Router, React 19)**
  - Server-first rendering, route handlers (`app/api/*`) for API endpoints, built-in optimizations (streaming, caching semantics), and excellent developer experience.
- **TypeScript**
  - Strong typing for safer refactors and clear contracts for domain models (web vitals, resources, AI outputs).
- **Tailwind CSS v4**
  - Utility-first styling ensures consistent spacing, typography, and responsive behavior; low CSS payload via build-time extraction.
- **Framer Motion 11**
  - Accessible, GPU-accelerated, reduced-motion aware animations with a compact API.
- **Recharts**
  - Lightweight, responsive charts for vitals/resource visualizations; integrates well with React and RSC boundaries.
- **Google PageSpeed Insights (PSI)**
  - Source of Lighthouse-derived metrics; standardized, widely trusted methodology.
- **Google Generative AI (Gemini)**
  - Converts raw metrics and diagnostics into human-friendly, prioritized recommendations; provides synthesis from performance signals.
- **Bun/Node toolchain**
  - Fast install/dev; works seamlessly with Next.js and TS.

## 2) Web Concepts Employed and Why

- **App Router and Route Handlers**
  - Keeps API logic colocated with UI, reduces latency and deployment complexity, leverages Next’s cache semantics.
- **Server Components (where possible)**
  - Less client JS, faster TTI, improved streaming; only interactive parts are Client Components.
- **Progressive Enhancement**
  - Core paths function without JS-heavy effects; motion/features detect `prefers-reduced-motion` and degrade gracefully.
- **Accessibility (ARIA, focus, labels)**
  - Form, buttons, banners include roles/labels; motion reduced for a11y; semantic HTML improves screen-reader flows.
- **Caching Semantics**
  - PSI (remote) data is fetched per request; UI is static-first. Print styles enable offline export.

## 3) Performance Techniques/Methodologies and Impact

- **Server-lean UI (RSC-first)**
  - Minimizes client bundle size; better TTFB and TTI.
- **Tailwind + utilities**
  - Eliminates ad-hoc CSS; reduces CSS cascade cost and payload size.
- **Motion discipline**
  - Entrance-only, reduced springing; `prefers-reduced-motion` respected; no layout-thrashing animations.
- **Visual complexity control**
  - Neutral, translucent surfaces, thin borders; avoids expensive shadows/filters; composited transforms only when needed.
- **Chunked visualizations**
  - Charts render within known containers; no reflow-heavy operations; responsive without remeasure loops.
- **Print/PDF mode**
  - Dedicated `@media print` reduces ink coverage, hides chrome, produces deterministic export.

Result: lower JS/CSS payload, fewer layout passes, predictable rendering, and good Core Web Vitals behavior in typical environments.

## 4) How AI Is Used to Measure and Explain Performance

- **Measurement**
  - PSI (Lighthouse) provides numeric metrics and category scores. AI is not used to measure; it interprets, correlates, and explains the metrics.
- **Interpretation**
  - Gemini receives: page URL, core metrics, category scores, resource breakdowns, and derived insights (opportunities/diagnostics). It returns:
    - Summary (plain language)
    - Critical issues (issue/impact/solution/expected improvement)
    - Optimization opportunities (category/difficulty/expected gain)
    - Priority actions (top tasks)
- **Rationale**
  - AI converts technical signals into user-centric, prioritized tasks with estimated gains, cutting time-to-action and reducing ambiguity for non-experts.

## 5) Metrics: How Obtained and Judged

- **Source: Google PageSpeed Insights v5 (Lighthouse JSON)**
  - Extracted: FCP, LCP, FID (max potential), CLS, TTFB; category scores (Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO).
- **Resource Analysis**
  - HEAD/GET inspection and heuristic modeling yield: total size, JS/CSS/HTML/Images sizes, requests, unused CSS/JS estimates, compression ratio.
- **Insights Engine (Deterministic)**
  - Rules evaluate thresholds (e.g., LCP > 2500 ms → high impact) and resource thresholds (e.g., images > 500KB → compress). Produces opportunities & diagnostics.
- **Judgement**
  - Metrics are mapped against Lighthouse/Web Vitals guidance:
    - FCP: quicker first paint improves perceived load.
    - LCP: core content visible quickly → primary UX signal.
    - FID/INP proxy: responsiveness.
    - CLS: layout stability.
    - TTFB: backend/network performance.
  - Category scores are normalized (0–100). AI summaries cross-reference both vitals and category health.

## 6) How AI Generates Recommendations (Basis)

- **Inputs**
  - Quantitative: vitals, category scores, resource sizes, counts, compression.
  - Qualitative: rule-based insights (opportunity list with savings/impact) constructed by `performance-analyzer.ts`.
- **Prompt Structure**
  - Model asked to output a strict JSON shape with: `summary`, `criticalIssues[]`, `optimizations[]`, `priorityActions[]`.
- **Heuristics**
  - Emphasis on: image optimization, code splitting/reduction, compression, caching, server response, layout stability.
- **Validation & Fallbacks**
  - JSON parse with guarded extraction; if AI returns non-JSON or fails, fallback recommendations are computed deterministically from thresholds.

## 7) Current Features and Future Improvements

### Current Features
- URL-based analysis with validation and normalized inputs.
- PSI-backed vitals and category scores with visualizations (donut, pie, bars).
- Resource breakdown with animated (once) progression and percentage labels.
- AI summary, critical issues, opportunities with difficulty/expected gain.
- Priority actions list.
- Sticky results navigation (desktop rail + mobile top bar) and floating actions (Top/Copy/Print).
- Theme system (light/dark), reduced‑motion handling, a11y semantics, print-ready export.

### Future Improvements
- Live field data (CrUX) integration where allowed (better real-user insight).
- Render-blocking detector: parse HTML/CSS to identify blocking resources.
- Image audit fetcher (content-type inspection, dimension mismatch detection, WebP/AVIF suggestions).
- Bundle analyzer hook (import size reports) for framework apps.
- First-party RUM snippet to capture INP/CLS deltas post-optimization.
- Persistent projects/runs and diffing across analyses.
- Export formats: Markdown/CSV, signed report links.

## 8) UI & Frontend Optimization System

### Visual Language
- Neutral, editorial layout with translucent panels (`bg-background/30`) and thin borders (`border-neutral-200/40`, dark-mode `white/10`).
- Subtle grid and noise backdrop to avoid sterile/AI-polished feel.
- Minimal color usage: accents only for status, bars, and tags.

### Motion & Interaction
- Framer Motion only for first-appearance (opacity/translate), no hover scaling on data tiles, honoring `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Charts animate initial draw only; no looping or reflow-heavy transitions.

### Components & Patterns
- Section-first composition (headings + body + divider). No heavy card chrome.
- Input and buttons: pill/rounded-xl, accessible labels, keyboard handling.
- Sticky rail on desktop with anchor jump; mobile sticky progress bar.

### Performance-Focused Frontend Techniques
- RSC-first: shrink client bundle; only interactive components marked `'use client'`.
- Tailwind utilities: no runtime CSS-in-JS overhead; CSS extraction reduces payload.
- Avoid deep shadows/backdrop filters; use composited transforms sparingly.
- Print stylesheet reduces layout for export; removes chrome.

## 9) Security & Privacy Considerations
- Input validation prevents malformed requests (`validateUrl`, `normalizeUrl`).
- No persistent storage of analyzed URLs by default.
- API key (Gemini) is server-side only; never exposed on the client.

## 10) Code Map

- `src/app/api/analyze/route.ts`
  - Validates URL, calls `PerformanceAnalyzer`, builds AI recommendations via `AIRecommendationService`, returns unified JSON.
- `src/lib/performance-analyzer.ts`
  - PSI fetch + extraction; resource heuristics; deterministic insight rules; fallbacks when APIs fail.
- `src/lib/ai-service.ts`
  - Gemini integration, prompt build, response parsing, deterministic fallback when AI fails.
- `src/components/*`
  - Results sections: `PerformanceScores`, `WebVitalsCard`, `ResourceAnalysisCard`, `AIRecommendations`.
  - Experience: `StatusBanner`, `LoadingAnalysis`, `StickyResultsBar`, `ThemeToggle`, `FloatingActions`, `BackgroundDecor`, `TiltCard`.

## 11) Data Shapes (Simplified)

- `WebVitalsData`: URL, FCP, LCP, FID (proxy), CLS, TTFB, category scores, timestamp.
- `ResourceAnalysis`: totalSize, jsSize, cssSize, imageSize, htmlSize, requests, unusedCss, unusedJs, compressionRatio.
- `AIRecommendation`: summary, criticalIssues[], optimizations[], priorityActions[].

## 12) Operational Notes

- **Environment**
  - `GEMINI_API_KEY` (required), `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` (optional dev convenience).
- **DX / Scripts**
  - `bun dev`, `bun run build`, `bun start`, `bun run lint`.
- **Deployment**
  - Vercel-friendly; add env vars per environment. Static assets hosted by Next.
